.. Django Endless Pagination documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Django Endless Pagination's documentation!
=====================================================

This app can be used to provide Twitter-style or Digg-style pagination, with
optional AJAX support and other features like multiple or lazy poagination.
The initial idea, which has guided the development of this application, 
is to allow pagination of web contents in very few steps.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   twitter_pagination
   digg_pagination
   multiple_pagination
